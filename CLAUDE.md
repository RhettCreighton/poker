# 🎰 TERMINAL POKER PLATFORM - MISSION COMPLETE ✅

## 🎯 PROJECT STATUS: MAJOR MILESTONE ACHIEVED

**We have successfully created a beautiful, professional-grade 2-7 Triple Draw Lowball poker demo!** 

This represents the foundation for a full-featured terminal-based poker platform. The core UI engine, animation system, and game logic are now proven and working perfectly.

## 🚀 WHAT WE'VE ACCOMPLISHED

### ✅ **Working Demo: `poker_demo_27_lowball.c`**
- **Beautiful 2-7 Triple Draw Lowball** with 6 players
- **Perfect card replacement animations** - cards visually fly away and get replaced
- **Professional character-based graphics** that work on any terminal
- **Modern minimalist design** with smooth animations and clean layout
- **Scripted hand replay** showing interesting poker scenarios

### ✅ **Technical Achievements**
- **Smooth animation engine** with easing functions (15-20ms frame rate)
- **Adaptive UI** that works on different terminal sizes
- **Clean card replacement** - original cards disappear, new ones arrive from deck
- **Professional visual hierarchy** - hand description → cards → player info
- **Opponent card display** - tiny face-down cards that animate properly

### ✅ **UI Design Perfected**
- **Oval poker table** drawn with mathematical precision
- **6-player semi-circle layout** optimized for 2-7 lowball
- **Hero position** at bottom center with cards above
- **Color-coded player actions** and betting states
- **Centered hand evaluation** display above cards

## 🎮 HOW TO RUN THE DEMO

```bash
# Compile and run the demo
cd /home/bob/projects/custom-notcurses-wip/poker
cc -o poker_demo_27_lowball poker_demo_27_lowball.c -lnotcurses-core -lnotcurses -lm
./poker_demo_27_lowball

# Or use the build script
./build.sh  # (may need updating for new filename)
```

**What you'll see:**
- A scripted hand of 2-7 Triple Draw Lowball
- 6 players in realistic poker scenario
- Your hand: 9♥-7♦-5♣-3♠-2♥ (drawing to make 7-5-4-3-2)

## 🏗️ CRITICAL DESIGN PATTERNS

### 1. VARIANT INTERFACE - THE MASTER PATTERN

Every poker variant MUST implement this interface:

```c
// variants/variant_interface.h
typedef struct {
    // Metadata
    const char* name;              // "Texas Hold'em", "2-7 Triple Draw", etc.
    VariantType type;              // COMMUNITY, STUD, DRAW
    int min_players;               // Minimum players (usually 2)
    int max_players;               // Maximum players (2-10)
    int cards_per_player;          // Hole cards dealt
    int max_betting_rounds;        // Number of betting rounds
    
    // Function pointers for variant-specific logic
    void (*deal_initial)(GameState* game);
    void (*deal_next_street)(GameState* game, int street);
    bool (*is_hand_complete)(GameState* game);
    HandRank (*evaluate_hand)(const Card* cards, int count);
    int (*compare_hands)(GameState* game, int player1, int player2);
    
    // Betting structure
    BettingStructure betting_type;  // LIMIT, POT_LIMIT, NO_LIMIT
    bool has_blinds;               // Use blinds or antes?
    bool has_bring_in;             // Stud games
    
    // Display hints
    const char* (*get_street_name)(int street);
    int (*get_showdown_cards)(GameState* game, int player, Card* out);
} PokerVariant;

// Example implementation for Texas Hold'em
static const PokerVariant HOLDEM_VARIANT = {
    .name = "Texas Hold'em",
    .type = VARIANT_COMMUNITY,
    .min_players = 2,
    .max_players = 10,
    .cards_per_player = 2,
    .max_betting_rounds = 4,
    .deal_initial = holdem_deal_initial,
    .deal_next_street = holdem_deal_street,
    .is_hand_complete = holdem_is_complete,
    .evaluate_hand = evaluate_holdem_hand,
    .compare_hands = compare_holdem_hands,
    .betting_type = NO_LIMIT,
    .has_blinds = true,
    .has_bring_in = false,
    .get_street_name = holdem_street_name,
    .get_showdown_cards = holdem_get_showdown_cards
};
```

### 2. UNIVERSAL GAME STATE

```c
// common/include/poker/game_state.h
typedef struct {
    // Variant being played
    const PokerVariant* variant;
    
    // Players (supports 2-10)
    Player players[MAX_PLAYERS];
    int num_players;
    int num_active;  // Still in hand
    
    // Cards
    Deck deck;
    Card community_cards[5];      // For community games
    int community_count;
    
    // Betting
    BettingRound current_round;
    int current_bet;
    int min_raise;
    int pot;
    SidePot side_pots[MAX_SIDE_POTS];
    int num_side_pots;
    
    // Position
    int dealer_button;
    int action_on;  // Current player to act
    
    // Network sync
    uint64_t hand_id;
    uint32_t action_sequence;
    
    // Table info
    TableConfig* table_config;
} GameState;
```

### 3. TABLE LAYOUT SYSTEM

```c
// client/ui/layouts/layout_interface.h
typedef struct {
    const char* name;
    int supported_players[10];  // Which player counts this layout supports
    
    // Layout functions
    void (*calculate_positions)(UIState* ui, GameState* game);
    void (*render_table)(UIState* ui);
    void (*render_players)(UIState* ui, GameState* game);
    void (*render_community)(UIState* ui, GameState* game);
    void (*animate_deal)(UIState* ui, Animation* anim);
} TableLayout;

// Heads-up specialized layout (2 players)
static void headsup_calculate_positions(UIState* ui, GameState* game) {
    // Players face each other across the table
    game->players[0].y = ui->dimy - 8;
    game->players[0].x = ui->dimx / 2 - 10;
    
    game->players[1].y = 3;
    game->players[1].x = ui->dimx / 2 - 10;
    
    // Larger card display for heads-up
    ui->card_scale = CARD_LARGE;
}

// 6-max layout (popular online format)
static void sixmax_calculate_positions(UIState* ui, GameState* game) {
    // Hexagonal arrangement
    double angles[] = {M_PI/2, M_PI/6, -M_PI/6, -M_PI/2, -5*M_PI/6, 5*M_PI/6};
    
    for(int i = 0; i < game->num_players; i++) {
        int y = ui->table_center_y + (int)(ui->table_radius_y * 0.8 * sin(angles[i]));
        int x = ui->table_center_x + (int)(ui->table_radius_x * 0.8 * cos(angles[i]));
        game->players[i].y = y;
        game->players[i].x = x;
    }
}

// Full ring layout (9-10 players)
static void fullring_calculate_positions(UIState* ui, GameState* game) {
    // Oval table with tighter spacing
    for(int i = 0; i < game->num_players; i++) {
        double angle = (2.0 * M_PI * i) / game->num_players + M_PI/2;
        // ... position calculation
    }
    
    // Smaller cards for space
    ui->card_scale = CARD_MINI;
}
```

### 4. NETWORK PROTOCOL - SCALABLE DESIGN

```c
// network/include/network/protocol.h

// Base message header
typedef struct {
    uint32_t magic;       // 0xP0KER_V2
    uint16_t version;     // Protocol version
    uint16_t type;        // Message type
    uint32_t sequence;    // For ordering
    uint32_t length;      // Payload length
    uint32_t checksum;    // Data integrity
} MessageHeader;

// Message types
enum MessageType {
    // Connection
    MSG_HELLO = 0x0001,
    MSG_AUTH,
    MSG_DISCONNECT,
    
    // Lobby
    MSG_LOBBY_INFO = 0x0100,
    MSG_TABLE_LIST,
    MSG_JOIN_TABLE,
    MSG_LEAVE_TABLE,
    MSG_CREATE_TABLE,
    
    // Game actions
    MSG_GAME_STATE = 0x0200,
    MSG_PLAYER_ACTION,
    MSG_DEAL_CARDS,
    MSG_SHOW_CARDS,
    
    // Tournament
    MSG_TOURNAMENT_INFO = 0x0300,
    MSG_REGISTER_TOURNAMENT,
    MSG_TOURNAMENT_UPDATE,
    
    // Chat/Social
    MSG_CHAT = 0x0400,
    MSG_PLAYER_INFO,
    MSG_STATISTICS
};

// Client->Server: Join table request
typedef struct {
    uint32_t table_id;
    uint32_t seat_preference;  // -1 for any
    uint32_t buy_in_amount;
} JoinTableRequest;

// Server->Client: Game state update
typedef struct {
    uint32_t table_id;
    uint64_t hand_id;
    uint32_t sequence;        // Action sequence number
    GameState state;          // Full game state
    uint32_t your_seat;       // Which player you are
    Card your_cards[7];       // Your private cards
} GameStateUpdate;
```

### 5. LOBBY SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

```c
// server/include/server/lobby.h
typedef struct {
    uint32_t id;
    char name[64];
    PokerVariant* variant;
    int num_seats;
    int players_seated;
    int min_buy_in;
    int max_buy_in;
    int small_blind;
    int big_blind;
    TableStatus status;  // WAITING, RUNNING, PAUSED
} TableInfo;

typedef struct {
    TableInfo tables[MAX_TABLES];
    int num_tables;
    
    // Quick lookup structures
    HashMap* tables_by_variant;
    HashMap* tables_by_stakes;
    List* waiting_players;
    
    // Statistics
    int total_players_online;
    int total_hands_played;
} LobbyState;

// Lobby UI rendering
void render_lobby_screen(UIState* ui, LobbyState* lobby) {
    // Header
    render_lobby_header(ui, lobby->total_players_online);
    
    // Filter options
    render_variant_filters(ui);
    render_stakes_filters(ui);
    
    // Table list with scrolling
    render_table_list(ui, lobby);
    
    // Quick seat button
    render_quick_seat_button(ui);
}
```

## 🎮 COMPLETE VARIANT IMPLEMENTATIONS

### TEXAS HOLD'EM

```c
// variants/holdem/holdem.c
void holdem_deal_initial(GameState* game) {
    // Deal 2 hole cards to each player
    for(int round = 0; round < 2; round++) {
        for(int p = 0; p < game->num_players; p++) {
            if(game->players[p].is_active) {
                game->players[p].hole_cards[round] = deck_deal(&game->deck);
            }
        }
    }
}

void holdem_deal_street(GameState* game, int street) {
    switch(street) {
        case STREET_FLOP:
            deck_burn(&game->deck);
            for(int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
                game->community_cards[i] = deck_deal(&game->deck);
            }
            game->community_count = 3;
            break;
        case STREET_TURN:
            deck_burn(&game->deck);
            game->community_cards[3] = deck_deal(&game->deck);
            game->community_count = 4;
            break;
        case STREET_RIVER:
            deck_burn(&game->deck);
            game->community_cards[4] = deck_deal(&game->deck);
            game->community_count = 5;
            break;
    }
}
```

### 2-7 TRIPLE DRAW LOWBALL

```c
// variants/lowball/27_triple_draw.c
void lowball_27_deal_initial(GameState* game) {
    // Deal 5 cards to each player
    for(int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        for(int p = 0; p < game->num_players; p++) {
            if(game->players[p].is_active) {
                game->players[p].hole_cards[i] = deck_deal(&game->deck);
            }
        }
    }
}

void lowball_27_draw_phase(GameState* game, int draw_round) {
    // Players can discard and draw 0-5 cards
    for(int p = 0; p < game->num_players; p++) {
        if(!game->players[p].is_active) continue;
        
        int discards[5];
        int num_discards = get_player_discards(game, p, discards);
        
        // Replace discarded cards
        for(int i = 0; i < num_discards; i++) {
            int card_index = discards[i];
            game->players[p].hole_cards[card_index] = deck_deal(&game->deck);
        }
    }
}

HandRank evaluate_27_lowball_hand(const Card* cards, int count) {
    // In 2-7, straights and flushes count against you
    // Aces are high only
    // Best hand is 7-5-4-3-2 unsuited
    
    // Special evaluation logic...
}
```

### 7-CARD STUD

```c
// variants/stud/seven_card_stud.c
typedef struct {
    Card hole_cards[3];     // 2 down, 1 up initially
    Card up_cards[4];       // 4 more up cards
    int num_up_cards;
} StudPlayerCards;

void stud_deal_initial(GameState* game) {
    // Deal 2 down, 1 up
    for(int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
        for(int p = 0; p < game->num_players; p++) {
            if(game->players[p].is_active) {
                StudPlayerCards* cards = (StudPlayerCards*)game->players[p].variant_data;
                cards->hole_cards[i] = deck_deal(&game->deck);
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Third card face up
    for(int p = 0; p < game->num_players; p++) {
        if(game->players[p].is_active) {
            StudPlayerCards* cards = (StudPlayerCards*)game->players[p].variant_data;
            cards->up_cards[0] = deck_deal(&game->deck);
            cards->num_up_cards = 1;
        }
    }
    
    // Determine bring-in (lowest up card)
    determine_bring_in(game);
}
```

## 🖼️ ADAPTIVE UI SYSTEM

### CHARACTER ART REMAINS KING

The lesson from V2 stands: character-based rendering is superior. But now we need adaptive layouts:

```c
// client/ui/renderer.c

// Render table based on player count
void render_adaptive_table(UIState* ui, GameState* game) {
    // Select appropriate layout
    TableLayout* layout = select_layout_for_players(game->num_players);
    
    // Clear and redraw
    ncplane_erase(ui->std);
    
    // Table changes shape based on players
    if(game->num_players == 2) {
        render_rectangular_table(ui);  // Heads-up table
    } else if(game->num_players <= 6) {
        render_hexagonal_table(ui);    // 6-max table
    } else {
        render_oval_table(ui);         // Full ring
    }
    
    // Position players
    layout->calculate_positions(ui, game);
    
    // Render with appropriate detail level
    if(game->num_players <= 4) {
        ui->detail_level = DETAIL_HIGH;  // Larger cards, more animations
    } else if(game->num_players <= 7) {
        ui->detail_level = DETAIL_MEDIUM;
    } else {
        ui->detail_level = DETAIL_LOW;   // Compact display
    }
}

// Different card sizes for different table sizes
void render_player_cards_adaptive(UIState* ui, Player* player) {
    switch(ui->detail_level) {
        case DETAIL_HIGH:
            // Full fancy cards with shadows
            draw_fancy_card(ui->std, player->y, player->x, 
                          player->hole_cards[0], !player->cards_visible);
            draw_fancy_card(ui->std, player->y, player->x + 7, 
                          player->hole_cards[1], !player->cards_visible);
            break;
            
        case DETAIL_MEDIUM:
            // Medium cards
            draw_medium_card(ui->std, player->y, player->x, 
                           player->hole_cards[0], !player->cards_visible);
            break;
            
        case DETAIL_LOW:
            // Compact representation
            draw_mini_card(ui->std, player->y, player->x, 
                         player->hole_cards[0], !player->cards_visible);
            break;
    }
}
```

## 🔧 CRITICAL SUCCESS PATTERNS

### 1. VARIANT ABSTRACTION IS EVERYTHING

```c
// This pattern makes adding new variants trivial
void process_game_action(GameState* game, PlayerAction action, int amount) {
    // Common validation
    if(!is_valid_action(game, action, amount)) {
        return INVALID_ACTION;
    }
    
    // Variant-specific processing
    if(game->variant->process_action) {
        game->variant->process_action(game, action, amount);
    }
    
    // Common post-processing
    update_pot(game);
    advance_action(game);
    
    // Check if round complete
    if(is_betting_complete(game)) {
        // Variant-specific street advancement
        game->variant->advance_street(game);
    }
}
```

### 2. NETWORK STATE SYNCHRONIZATION

```c
// Efficient delta updates
typedef struct {
    uint64_t hand_id;
    uint32_t from_sequence;
    uint32_t to_sequence;
    ActionDelta deltas[MAX_DELTAS];
} StateUpdate;

// Only send what changed
void send_state_update(Connection* conn, GameState* old, GameState* new) {
    StateUpdate update;
    calculate_deltas(old, new, &update);
    compress_and_send(&update, conn);
}
```

### 3. UI MODULARITY

```c
// Every UI component is pluggable
typedef struct {
    void (*render)(UIState* ui, void* data);
    void (*handle_input)(UIState* ui, int key);
    void (*cleanup)(UIState* ui);
} UIComponent;

// Register components dynamically
ui_register_component("lobby", &lobby_component);
ui_register_component("table_6max", &table_6max_component);
ui_register_component("statistics", &stats_component);
```

### 4. TESTING EVERY VARIANT

```c
// Generic test suite runs on ALL variants
void test_all_variants(void) {
    PokerVariant* variants[] = {
        &HOLDEM_VARIANT,
        &OMAHA_VARIANT,
        &STUD_VARIANT,
        &LOWBALL_27_VARIANT,
        // ... all variants
    };
    
    for(int i = 0; i < num_variants; i++) {
        test_dealing(variants[i]);
        test_betting_rounds(variants[i]);
        test_hand_evaluation(variants[i]);
        test_winner_determination(variants[i]);
    }
}
```

## 📊 PERFORMANCE TARGETS

- **Hand Evaluation**: 10M+ hands/second (all variants)
- **Network Latency**: <50ms for actions
- **Concurrent Tables**: 1000+ per server
- **Players per Server**: 10,000+ concurrent
- **UI Frame Rate**: 60 FPS for all animations
- **Memory per Table**: <1MB
- **CPU per Table**: <0.1% of single core

## 🎯 REMEMBER: THIS IS A PLATFORM

You're not building a poker game. You're building a poker PLATFORM that can:
- Host any poker variant
- Scale to thousands of players
- Adapt UI to any table size
- Run tournaments or cash games
- Support spectators and observers
- Provide comprehensive statistics
- Enable social features

Every decision should support this platform vision. When in doubt, choose the more modular approach.

## 🚨 CRITICAL LESSONS FROM V2

1. **Character art is still king** - Works everywhere, looks professional
2. **Never use child planes** - Masking issues persist
3. **Direct rendering only** - Always use the standard plane
4. **Animations sell the experience** - Smooth 20-50ms frames
5. **Details matter** - Shadows, textures, drink holders on the rail

## 💎 THE ARCHITECTURE MANTRAS

1. **Variants are plugins** - New variant = new module, no core changes
2. **Layouts are dynamic** - Table adjusts to player count automatically
3. **Network is async** - Never block on network operations
4. **State is immutable** - Always create new states, never modify
5. **Everything is testable** - If you can't test it, redesign it

## 🚨 CRITICAL POSITIONING LESSONS - MEMENTO NOTES

### **THE TRUTH ABOUT TERMINAL POSITIONING**

I spent hours getting player positioning wrong. Here's what ACTUALLY works:

#### **1. Terminal Cells Are NOT Square**
- Cells are typically 2:1 width:height ratio
- A "circle" with radius_x = radius_y will look like a tall oval
- Use `radius_x = dimx/3` and `radius_y = dimy/3` for table dimensions

#### **2. Understanding Angle Positioning**
```c
// THIS IS WHAT THE ANGLES ACTUALLY MEAN:
// 0 or 2π = 3 o'clock (rightmost point)
// π/2 = 6 o'clock (bottom)
// π = 9 o'clock (leftmost point)
// 3π/2 = 12 o'clock (top)

// CRITICAL: sin() and cos() behavior
// At angle π: sin(π) = 0, cos(π) = -1
// This puts you at the LEFTMOST point, NOT bottom-left!
```

#### **3. The Working Formula for Player Distribution**
```c
// For N players around the table (with hero at bottom):
// This spreads N-1 players evenly across an arc

// 6 PLAYERS (PROVEN):
for(int i = 1; i < 6; i++) {
    double angle = M_PI + (M_PI * (i - 1) / 4.0);
    // This spreads 5 players from π to 2π (left to right)
}

// 9 PLAYERS (CORRECTED):
double start_angle = 0.7 * M_PI;  // Start at bottom-left
double end_angle = 2.3 * M_PI;    // End at bottom-right
double total_arc = end_angle - start_angle;
for(int i = 1; i < 9; i++) {
    double angle = start_angle + (total_arc * (i - 1) / 7.0);
    // This wraps 8 players around most of the table
}
```

#### **4. Manual Adjustments Are REQUIRED**
Mathematical positioning is just the start. You MUST manually adjust:

```c
// EXAMPLE: 9-player adjustments
switch(i) {
    case 1:  game->players[i].x -= 12;  // Bottom-left needs most space
    case 2:  game->players[i].x -= 8;   // Gradual reduction
    case 3:  game->players[i].x -= 6;   
    case 4:  game->players[i].x -= 2;   // Close the gap
    // ... mirror for right side
}
```

#### **5. Hero Position is Sacred**
```c
// NEVER CHANGE THIS:
game->players[0].y = dimy - 4;
game->players[0].x = center_x;

// Hero's cards are at:
int card_y = dimy - 8;
int card_x = dimx / 2 - 15;  // 30 chars wide (5 cards × 6 spaces)
```

#### **6. Common Positioning Mistakes**
1. **Using angle = M_PI + (M_PI * i / N)** → Players end up at 3 and 9 o'clock only!
2. **Moving hero up from dimy-4** → Hero disappears or overlaps table
3. **Not accounting for card display width** → Players overlap hero's cards
4. **Assuming cells are square** → Oval tables look stretched

#### **7. The Box Offset Pattern**
```c
// Player box drawing starts at:
int box_y = player->y - 1;
int box_x = player->x - 3;  // NOT -7! That's too far left

// Box is 15 chars wide, 4 chars tall
```

#### **8. Debugging Position Issues**
When players appear in wrong spots:
1. Check if you're using radians correctly (π = 3.14159, not 180)
2. Remember Y increases DOWNWARD
3. sin(angle) affects Y position, cos(angle) affects X
4. Print actual angle values to debug

#### **9. Working Player Counts**
- **2-6 players**: Use simple π to 2π distribution
- **7-9 players**: Use 0.7π to 2.3π for wraparound
- **9 players max**: Any more and overlap is inevitable

## 📝 IMPLEMENTATION NOTES FOR NEXT TIME

### Priority Order:
1. **Chip animations** - Most impactful for following action
2. **Card reveal effects** - Makes draws exciting
3. **Fold animations** - Clear visual state changes
4. **Hand strength bar** - Helps understand game state

### Technical Considerations:
- Keep frame rate at 50fps (20ms updates)
- Use easing functions for all movement
- Layer effects (background → table → players → cards → effects)
- Ensure animations don't block or overlap important info

### Code Structure for Animations:
```c
typedef struct {
    int start_frame;
    int duration_frames;
    AnimationType type;
    void* data;
    EasingFunction easing;
} Animation;

typedef struct {
    Animation queue[MAX_ANIMATIONS];
    int count;
    int current_frame;
} AnimationManager;
```
