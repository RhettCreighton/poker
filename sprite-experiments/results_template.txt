=== SPRITE RENDERING EXPERIMENT RESULTS ===
Date: $(date)
Terminal: $TERM
Goal: Understand why card sprites appear blurry and find optimal rendering

EXPERIMENT 1: Blitter Comparison
Question: Which blitter produces the clearest card images?
Observations:
- PIXEL blitter: 
- 2x1 blitter: 
- 2x2 blitter: 
- BRAILLE blitter: 
- 1x1 blitter: 
Best for clarity: 
Notes: 

EXPERIMENT 2: Scaling Methods  
Question: Is pre-resizing vs. notcurses scaling causing blurriness?
Observations:
- Method 1 (Pre-resize): 
- Method 2 (NCSCALE_SCALE): 
- Method 3 (Pixel + Scale): 
- Method 4 (Larger size): 
Best method: 
Blurriness cause: 
Notes:

EXPERIMENT 3: Terminal Capabilities
Question: What does this terminal actually support?
Observations:
- Terminal type: 
- Cell aspect ratio: 
- Pixel support: 
- Available blitters: 
- AUTO blitter choice: 
Optimal settings: 
Notes:

CONCLUSIONS:
1. Primary cause of blurriness: 
2. Optimal blitter for this terminal:
